# Fraud-Detector
### Overview
A multinational Financial Services firm with headquarters in London, UK, that offers retail and investment banking, pension management, asset management and payment services wants to build a machine learning model to predict online payment fraud in other to block leakages in its revenue.
This problem was tackled by first extensively performing a Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the interactions of the various parameters contained in the dataset. The EDA also hinted the features that are strongly correlated to the label, highlighting transaction details that should paid close attention to.
Five (5) different models were trained and their performances evaluated to determine the best performer. 
The most outstanding model was deployed in tackling the problem and a 90.9% efficiency was attained.
However, because the model is not 100% efficient, there are still instances were the model would produce false positives. Further investigations are still needed to truly asceratin the true validity of those transactions.
